      2.4

        Logic vs clauses

        Clause coverage
        Combinational coverage
        Active clause coverage
          General
          Correlated
          Restricted
          (DONT WORRY AOBUT INACTIVE CLAUSE COVERAGE)
      3.3
        K-Maps
        DNF predicate
          Implicant coverage
          Unique True Point coverage  -Needs minimal DNF w/ K-map
          Unique False Point coverage -Needs minimal DNF w/ K-map
      3.3.1
        Transformation issues - Not heavily covered, but should be aware

    Chapter 4 =================================================
      ISP - Input Space Partitioning
      4.1
        Interface-based partitioning
        Simplest
        PWC - Pair-Wise Coverage
        TWC - T-Wise coverage
        AOCC
        BCC  - Base Choices
        MBCC - Multiple Base Choices

    K-MAPS =====================================================

      P == A AND (!b OR c) == a(!b+c)

      DNF == ( a AND !b ) OR ( a AND c )

      P == a!b + ac

      Map guide

      c\ab _00_01__11__10_
        0 |_0_|_1_|_2_|_3_|
        1 |_4_|_5_|_6_|_7_|

      K-MAP:

      c\ab _00_01__11__10_
        0 |_0_|_0_|_0_|_1_|
        1 |_0_|_0_|_1_|_1_|

      When A determines the value
        Groups: [3, 7, 0, 4], [5, 6]
          1. !b OR (b AND c)
          2. (!b OR b) AND (!b OR c)
          3. !b OR c
      When B determines the value
        Groups: [2, 3]
          1. a AND !c

      When C determines the value
        Groups: [2, 6]
          1. a AND b

      To make a minimal DNF, don't include 0s in the K-map, just minimize number of clusters of 1s.

    IMPLICANT COVERAGE =============================================
      1. Implicaint Coverage
        Start with a DNF - DOES NOT HAVE TO MINIMAL
        Obtain F
        Obtain F-BAR
        Require test requirements contain all implicants that evaluate to true.
          EX - F = ab OR b!c
              !F = !b OR (!a AND c)
              Implicants: a, b, c
                ab       |T  T
                b!c      |   T  F
                !b       |   F
                !a AND c |F     T

                4 test cases, can be reduced to two. [(TTF),(FFT)]

                This isn't very thorough, but at least covers all the implicants.



      2. Unique True Point
        Like Implicant, but without combining
        Unique points in implicant are true, all other points are false.
        Start with a MINIMAL DNF
        Obtain F
        Obtain F-BAR
        Require test requirements to contain a unique true point for each implicant in F and in each implicant in F-BAR
          EX - F = ab OR b!c <- Already minimal DNF
              !F = !b OR (!a AND c)

              Implicants: a, b, c
                ab       |T  T  T
                b!c      |F  T  F
                !b       |T  F  T, T F F, F F F
                !a AND c |F  F  T


      3. Correspoinding Unique True Point coverage
      4. Near False Point coverage
