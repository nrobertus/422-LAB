Lecture 4/20/16

A lecture from an intern at Zoot to a handful of deadpan seniors. Great.

=========================================================================
= Defining and Applying Test Coverage Criterion in an Industrial Domain = <-- this looks suspiciously like a capstone presentation...
=========================================================================

Zoot Enterprises <- Yep, this definitely sponsored content
 made a tool called WebRules, somehow I should care
  Oh wait, WebRules is like Zoot's little version of LabView... Drag and drop pre-baked code blocks. Terrific.

Zoot statement blocks
  Attributes
  Rules
  Procedures

Testing
  Attribute coverage - The number of attributes being tested in a platform
  Rule coverage - Exercise rules with a test
  Procedure coverage - number of procedures tested

  Apparently Zoot doesn't (or maybe didn't? not sure) have great coverage. Like 80% coverage on most things.

Prioritizing coverage
  Object complexity
  risk-based
  # of dependencies

Complexity:
  McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity - Google it. pretty much the number of branches
  More complexity = more tests. Duh.

Editor's note: His color choices on graphs are insane. Chartreuse for lines between nodes? What on earth?

Another editor's note: Right now, two people are picking their noses, five are on reddit, and one is almost asleep.
                       If we are testing the coverage of people not paying attention, we are at almost 80%, approaching
                       the limits of Zoot's testing coverage.
