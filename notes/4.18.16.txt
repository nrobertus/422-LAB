==  METAMORPHIC TESTING  ==
===========================

You can't actually prove a program is correct, you can just increase your confidence that it is.

Components:
  Program
  Test cases (automated or manually written)
  Outputs from program (prompted by test cases)
  Test oracle (compares inputs and outputs)


In scientific software, oracles don't exist, or are difficult to implement

Black box testing method, but with domain knowledge
Rather than comparing inputs/outputs, look for specific metamorphic relations

Metamorphic relations
  Specifies how the output should change dependent on the change in input

Example: MR Addition
  Input change: output should increase or remain constant

Applications:
  Bioinformatics
  Machine Learning
  Mathematics
